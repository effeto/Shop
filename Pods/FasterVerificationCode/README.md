iOS 10.0 or above

## Installation

#### As a CocoaPods Dependency

Add the following to your Podfile:
``` ruby
pod 'FasterVerificationCode'
```

### Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into `Xcode`.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding FasterVerificationCode as a dependency is very easy. You've just to add it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/posix88/FasterVerificationCode", .upToNextMajor(from: "0.4.1"))
]
```

#### Manual Installation

All of the necessary source and resource files for `FasterVerificationCode` are in `FasterVerificationCode/Classes`.

## Examples
Using `FasterVerificationCode` is very easy and straightforward. Create a new UIView into your ViewController and insert into the Custom class field  `VerificationCodeView`.

You can customize the appearance through the inspector tab and add your constraints. 

Don't forget to: 
- add a width constraint; 
- declare it as placeholder (the view will resize at runtime following labels dimensions).

For a complete working example, check out the repo and run `pod install` into the project root.

### Basic Implementation

```swift
@IBOutlet weak var verificationCodeView: VerificationCodeView!

override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    verificationCodeView.setLabelNumber(6)
    verificationCodeView.delegate = self
}

extension YourViewController: VerificationCodeViewDelegate {

    func verificationCodeInserted(_ text: String, isComplete: Bool) { 
    ...
    }
}
```
### VerificationCodeViewDelegate

This delegate handle the insertion of the verification code with this two method:

#### verificationCodeInserted

```swift
func verificationCodeInserted(_ text: String, isComplete: Bool)
```

This method is mandatory and is called every time the `textFieldShouldEndEditing` method of the textfield is called.
It gives you the current text and if the text was inserted totally.

You can check the correctness of the inserted code and show a visual feedback to the user

```swift
    if text == "123456" {
        .....
    } else {
        // The inserted code is wrong
        verificationCodeView.showError = true
    }
```

#### verificationCodeChanged (optional)

```swift
@objc optional func verificationCodeChanged()
```
This method is optional and is called only when the user is deleting a character. It should be implemented only if you are interested in error handling and you want to reset the border color to the default color you inserted.

```swift
    func verificationCodeChanged() {
        verificationCodeView.showError = false
    }
```
